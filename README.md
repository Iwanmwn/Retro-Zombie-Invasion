# Retro-Zombie-Invasion
Actually not so much retro and invasion yet, but it is going to be like that before good times come.
The reason I share my project is that I lost wish to work with this project somehow.

Hope it will help somebody more ambitious than me, but I also must warn you that the game is too far from complete realisation.
Some goals i leave in goals.txt file, if you want to create a game based on this project, you should check it.

Used libraris: LibGDX 1.6.5
